- 👋 Hi, I’m Daniel Nikolaev. I am a self-thought python developer with Ph.D. in finance.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python in both scientific aspects (NumPy, SKlearn, Pandas), AI (TensorFlow, Keras), and also as a back-end web development (Django). Along the way, I have also learned JavaScript, mostly vanilla with little jQuery.
- 🌱 I’m currently working .
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to my first web-dev / data science work.
