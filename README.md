- 👋 Hi, I’m (Daniel Nikolaev) @Dah-phd. I am a self-thought python developer with Ph.D. in finance.
- 👀 I’m interested in Python in both scientific aspects (NumPy, SKlearn, Pandas), AI (TensorFlow, Keras), and also as a back-end web development (Django). Along the way, I have also learned JavaScript, mostly vanilla with little jQuery.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking into Rust as a way to extend both python and JS, also it seems solid as a high-performance language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on python projects. And also looking forward to my first web-dev / data science work.
- 📫 How to reach me daniel_nikolaev@outlook.com // https://www.daniel-py.net/.
