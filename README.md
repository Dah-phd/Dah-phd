# Hi, I’m Daniel Nikolaev. 
* I am a self-thought Python/TypeScript/Rust developer with Ph.D. in finance.
# Current occupation: 
* I have professional experience in automating accounting processes using Python scripts and notebooks, with a heavy focus on Pandas and NumPy. My current working project is a microservice related to accounting and reporting SaaS, that includes quite a few components from custom ORM, to XML-based workflows.
* The structure I am currently working on can be classified as Agile, although the release schedule is far from standard.
# Interests:
* general interest in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and low-level programming.
* scientific interest in AI ( mostly related to TensorFlow, Keras).
* web-development back-end (Django / Rocket) and frontend (Solid-JS, with future plans to test Rust-Yew).
# Personal project:
* My latest personal projects is using Rust and [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework. The idea behind it is to create a end-to-end web application allowing peer-to-peer or AI games of [Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor). The front-end is built using TypeScript with Solid-JS as a framework. The goal of the project is to get a better understanding of Rust as a back-end language and component-based frontend.
* Related to that I had to implement path-finding algorithm (A*) that I deployed as open-source [Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/a-star_traitbased)
* [Back-end source code.](https://github.com/Dah-phd/corridor_api)
* [Frontend source code.](https://github.com/Dah-phd/corridor_frontend)
# Future plans:
* I’m looking forward to my first professional Rust project.
